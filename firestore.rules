/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the financial institutions app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows public read access to financial institution data while restricting write access to authenticated users.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All institution data is stored in the `/institutions/{institutionId}` collection.
 *
 * Key Security Decisions:
 * - Public read access is granted to the `/institutions` collection, assuming all data is safe for public consumption.
 * - Write access (create, update, delete) to the `/institutions` collection is restricted to authenticated users.
