/**
 * @fileOverview Firestore Security Rules for the multi-category info app.
 *
 * Core Philosophy:
 * This ruleset allows public read access to all data while restricting
 * write access to authenticated users, who are considered administrators.
 * This is a common pattern for apps with public content managed by admins.
 *
 * Data Structure:
 * All data is stored in the `/institutions/{institutionId}` collection.
